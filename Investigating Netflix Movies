##Questions
Perform exploratory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv data to understand more about movies from the 1990s decade.

What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).

A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.

##Solution
# Importing pandas and matplotlib
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read in the Netflix CSV as a DataFrame
netflix_df = pd.read_csv("netflix_data.csv")

# most frequent movie duration in the 1990s
# Filter to movies only
movies = netflix_df[netflix_df["type"] == "Movie"]

# Filter to the 1990s: 1990 ≤ release_year < 2000
movies_90s = movies[(movies["release_year"] >= 1990) & (movies["release_year"] < 2000)]

# Calculate the most frequent duration (mode)
duration = int(movies_90s["duration"].mode()[0])
print("Most frequent duration in 1990s:", duration)

# Count short action movies in the 1990s
# "Short" = duration < 90, genre == "Action"
short_action = movies_90s[(movies_90s["genre"] == "Action") & (movies_90s["duration"] < 90)]
short_movie_count = len(short_action)
print("Number of short action movies in 1990s:", short_movie_count)

Most frequent duration in 1990s: 94
Number of short action movies in 1990s: 7
